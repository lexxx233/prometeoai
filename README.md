# Manifesto of Prometeo Project - Private Personal AI Companion

## Summary of Idea
This project seeks to implement The Operating System for Personal AI Companion that run locally on personal computers. 
This agent will utilize the most advanced publicly available models for Reasoning, Multimodal Inputs and Outputs

### Definitions

#### Operating System for AI Companion

A system which orchestrate AI models for different human interactions

        
    Users ---------------------> Input Mode-----> Reasoning Model
          /\                                            \/
            \--------Output Mode<--------------------Response ----->  Personal Memory Archive and Retrieval



#### Personal AI Companion
A reasoning agent possessing relevant memory and defined personality
+ Reasoning agent : swappable LLM models (per user preferences) with information retrival and reasoning capabilities.
+ Relevant Memory: embedding of key conversations and interactions, personal facts and best assumption of user personality and attributes
+ Defined Personality: The agent possesses a personality that evolves in a believable manner. I.e. as models are swapped in and out, the agent has memory about itself that is positively consistent with the interaction with user.

### The Most advanced publicly available models
We will seek to focus this project on creating a coherent agents by connecting connecting all models from various foundation models. 
Connection is the name of this project.
That means we will prioritize developing interfaces with models over developing new models ourselves 

### Run locally on personal computer
Because we are developing interfaces for models. User can install and swapout the interaction models that fit the hardware capacity of their own personal computer
Users can utilize any models that fit their hardware budget

### Multimodal Inputs
Text Input (Native - can be used for private conversations)
Audio Input (Prioritize)
Interface for future mode of inputs
      - Live Image Inputs
      - Tactile / Physical Inputs
      - Other sensory information

### Multilmodal Outputs
Text Output (Native - can be used for private conversation)
Audio Output
Image output
Image sequence Output
