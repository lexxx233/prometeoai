## Development Approach

1. Modular Design
   - Separate core components
   - Pluggable architecture
   - Standard interfaces

2. Interface Driven Development
   - Develop interfaces first
   - Interfaces are the only way to interact with the core components

3. Iterative Development
   - Start with basic text functionality
   - Continuous integration of new models and features

4. Community FOcus
    - Open Interfaces
    - Documentation
    - Plugin System
